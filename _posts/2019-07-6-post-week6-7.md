My first evaluation is already complete and I passed it successfully.Also my college has also started and it did caused little disturbance to my work, but anyways I was back to work after little hicupps.I discussed with my mentors ,in which we concluded that after some more feature enhancement in the app, the mentors along with the institute students will be annotating the pose and we will then start with the computer vision.Basically I was asked to add these few feature:

</ul>

<p>Things yet to implemented </p>
<ul>
<li>ability to delete a pose </li>
<li>ability to add a pose in cases where openpose couldn't detect person</li>
<li>add tag to corrected pose parts</li>
<li>visualize the corrected pose as a kind of lst check</li>
<li>iterate through the poses using a button rather than selecting the pose no and image file as done previously</li>
<li>Do some bug fixes in the APIs</li>
</ul>
