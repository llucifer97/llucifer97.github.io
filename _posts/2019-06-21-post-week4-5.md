This is fourth week and the final week before my first evaluation.As in my last blog mentioned there was a couple of stuff like databases for storing the data of pose co-ordinates and its metadata ,also build a restful API for accessing the data stored in databases.So,I started with learning about Database and looking out for the best suited database for  storing data.After doing some research I found MongoDB to be the best suited databse bcoz it is a NoSQL database which gives us the more flexiblity over the conventional SQL database and also my data was in JSON format very close to the form MondoDB stores the data i.e in BSON format. I used the free tier MongoDB atlas for storing the data in cloud.
Next Challenge was designing APIs for storing and accessing data from database.For building restful APIS I used the 'Flask' library,which gives u quite a useful methods for rapidly creating APIs and sharing it with your users.So exploring and learning alone took one week and another one week in designing and creating the full pipeline right from getting the image link to storing the corrected pose in a database.This part of the project was really a great learning experience for me and gave me an oppurtunity to think out of the box to design and implement stuff from scratch.

One last thing that was left and was the most painful was building a singularity container for openpose to run it on HPC cluster.It took quite a lot of time of mine,after trying for two weeks I was finally able to build a singularity container.I have open sourced the [script](https://github.com/llucifer97/Pose-analysis-of-art/blob/master/openpose_cpu),you can use.

To run the singularity container simply use the following command:

```
singularity run --bind /mnt/rds/redhen/gallina/home/axr855/output:/localdata/src/openpose/output,/mnt/rds/redhen/gallina/home/axr855/image:/localdata/src/openpose/examples/media --writable sushil_pose_2.simg

```
So this is it,stay tuned to know more!
